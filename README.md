Critical Thinking Assignment 5 is part of DS620 (Data Visualization) course

### CT5: Data Scientist Job Market in the U.S.

In this critical thinking, our mission is to create Python graphics for Covid-19 dataset. In this assignment, we will complete the following tasks: Examine the information provided. Examine the dataset for missing values and, if any exist, fill them with 0s. Each column's data should be converted to a suitable data type. Create interactive maps that illustrate where each geographical column is located (latitude and longitude). Sort the information into categories that make sense to you. Using the relevant chart, choose and visualize the data. The dataset used for this critical thinking was retrieved from the Kaggle called Coronavirus Lat/Long Dataset. The following is the dataset's processed version from 2019 Coronavirus dataset (January - February 2020) dataset. To make geographic analysis easier, author replaced NAs with 0 and added longitude and latitude columns.
